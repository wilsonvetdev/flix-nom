# Flix-Nom

This is a side project I did to practice using hooks since it is best practice now compared to using class components. 
The single page application allows a user to search for movies with the search field, and also allows add movies to a nomination list.
The nomination list is automatically saved to their browser, so even if they refresh or leave page - the list stays on the browser until they remove the movies.

# Tech

* React(Components, Hooks)
* Semantic UI React for a little bit of styling
* localStorage for saving nomination list
